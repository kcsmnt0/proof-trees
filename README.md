This is a little library of reusable UI components for interactively editing proof trees.

[`Arboretum`](https://kcsmnt0.github.io) combines the components into a web app for building trees in a proof theory for intuitionistic propositional logic. The plan is to add components for interactively editing the syntax and semantics of a theory in addition to proofs within the theory.
